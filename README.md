🧠 AI_Vision Toolkit
AI_Vision Toolkit is a powerful, flexible, and developer-friendly toolkit designed to simplify the development of real-time computer vision applications using artificial intelligence. Built with modularity and scalability in mind, it allows developers and researchers to build and deploy smart vision systems with ease. Whether you're working on object detection, image classification, or intelligent automation, this toolkit provides the essential building blocks.

At its core, the toolkit integrates popular libraries such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, and supports pre-trained models like YOLO, MobileNet, and ResNet. The architecture is designed to allow quick customization and easy integration with camera feeds, video input, and user interfaces through Streamlit or Flask.
